Price Prediction Application

Summary: An application that predicts the future price of securities (crypto/stocks/forex, etc.). Price data is imported into a central database, where it is both fed into a machine learning algorithm that predicts future price movements, as well as converted into a human readable form (OHLC formatted candlestick charts). The database can be accessed via a GUI, and will have (at least) two tiers of access: administrators and users.

Primary Data Source: https://data.binance.vision/ (crypto price data)
