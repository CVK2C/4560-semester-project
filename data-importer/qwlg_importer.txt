Certainly! Below is the Python code that accomplishes the tasks you've

1. A function to search a specified directory for `.parquet` and `CSV`

2. A function to open one `.parquet` file at a time, read it into a pandas 
DataFrame, rename its columns, and write the modified data into a new 
file.

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pyarrow pandas
```

### Explanation:

1. **list_files_in_directory(directory):**
   - This function searches the given directory for `.parquet` and `CSV` 
files using `os.walk`.
   - It collects file paths in two separate lists: one for `.parquet` 
files and another for CSV files.
   
2. **process_parquet_file(parquet_path, output_directory):**
   - This function reads a specified `.parquet` file into a pandas 
DataFrame.
   - It renames all columns by prepending `'new_'` to the original column 
names (you can modify this renaming logic as needed).
   - The modified DataFrame is then written to a new `.parquet` file in 
the specified output directory.

### Example Usage:
- Replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the path of the directory you 
want to search.
- Replace `'/path/to/output/directory'` with the path where you want to 
save the modified .parquet files.
- The script will print out all found `.parquet` and CSV files, and then 
process each `.parquet` file by renaming its columns and saving the result 
in the specified output directory.

   - This function searches the given directory for `.parquet` and `CSV` 
files using `os.walk`.
   - It collects file paths in two separate lists: one for `.parquet`

2. **process_csv_to_parquet(csv_path, output_directory):**
   - This function reads a specified CSV file line by line into a pandas 
DataFrame while ignoring the CSV headers.
   - It assigns default column names (e.g., `column_0`, `column_1`, etc.). 
You can adjust the number of columns as needed.
   - The DataFrame is built in chunks, and each chunk is written to a 
`.parquet` file.
   - The function checks the size of the current `.parquet` file using 
`Path.stat().st_size`.
   - If the file size exceeds 128 MiB, it starts writing to a new 
`.parquet` file.

### Example Usage:
- Replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the path of the directory you 
want to search.
- Replace `'/path/to/output/directory'` with the path where you want to 
save the created `.parquet` files.
- The script will print out all found `.parquet` and CSV files, and then 
process each CSV file by reading it line by line, renaming its columns, 
and saving the result in chunks of approximately 128 MiB into separate 
`.parquet` files.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> The script you wrote is constantly overwriting the same file, rather than le
... tting it grow to approx 128 MiB and creating a new parquet file to write to.
... 
You're correct that the current implementation is overwriting the same 
file instead of allowing it to grow to approximately 128 MiB before 
creating a new one. Let's address this by ensuring that each chunk is 
appended correctly to the existing `.parquet` file until it reaches the 
desired size, and then a new file is created.

Here's the corrected version of the script:

>>> Use pyarrow to write to .parquet files, not pandas
Certainly! To ensure that we use `pyarrow` for writing to `.parquet`
